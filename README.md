# Secure-Password-Generator

**Goal:**

The primary goal of the Secure Password Generator is to provide users with a reliable and user-friendly way to generate secure passwords tailored to their specific requirements.

**Overview:**

The Secure Password Generator is a Python-based tool designed to create strong, random passwords to enhance account security. By allowing users to define password characteristics such as length and the inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, the tool generates passwords that meet varying security needs. This project provides an easy way for users to create complex passwords that are more resistant to hacking attempts than typical, manually chosen passwords.

**Tools Used**

Python: The core programming language used to build and execute the password generator.

Jupyter Notebook: An interactive environment for writing and running Python code, enabling easy testing and visualization of the code's output.

string Module: Used to access character sets such as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters for the password components.

random Module: Utilized to randomly select characters from the defined character sets to construct a secure password.
